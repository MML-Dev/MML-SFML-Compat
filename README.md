# MML-SFML-Compat

For testing compatibility between MML and SFML API

The intention here is not for 100% compatibility, but to provide enough compatibility that a user can easily switch between MML and SFML without changing their project code.

This also builds a selection of popular SFML libraries with MML, to confirm that switching between the two is still viable.
